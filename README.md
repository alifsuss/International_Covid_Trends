# International_Covid_Trends
This Script collected data from https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/ and select countries based on their country code. 
Then plot the total_cases VS daily_cases in log-log mode. 
You will see linearity, providing the case is still increasing. drop, if the covid has vinished. 
You will see that most countries performed almost the same trends. The difference is the timing. 
This way we can compare countries performances in tackling COVID-19 problem more subjectively.

Please give me feedback on how to make the code neater!
